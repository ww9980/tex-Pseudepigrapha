\Chapter

\Verse And it came to pass in the twenty-fifth year of Jeconiah, king of Judah, that the word of the \LORD came to Baruch, the son of Neriah, and said to him: 犹大王耶哥尼雅\footnote{耶哥尼雅（Jeconiah）即哥尼雅、约雅斤（Jehoiachin），是法老所立的王，为法老征税。
参王下二三34～35。
}二十五年，耶和华的话语传到尼雅的儿子巴鲁克那里，对他说：
\Verse 'Have you seen all that this people are doing to Me, that the evils which these two tribes which remained have done are greater than (those of) the ten tribes which were carried away captive 
'你可曾看见这百姓对我所行的一切，这两个支派所行的恶，比被掳走的十个支派所行的恶还大。
\Verse For the former tribes were forced by their kings to commit sin, but these two of themselves have been forcing and compelling their kings to commit sin. 
因为以前的诸支派是被他们的国王们逼迫的，而这犹大、便雅悯的民\footnote{
these two of themselves. 犹大国主要是犹大、便雅悯两支派。
}却一直在逼迫和蛊惑他们的国王们犯罪。
\Verse For this reason, behold I bring evil upon this city, and upon its inhabitants, and it shall be removed from before Me for a time, and I will scatter this people among the Gentiles that they may do good to the Gentiles. And My people shall be chastened, and the time shall come when they will seek for the prosperity of their times. 
因为这个原因，看哪，我将罪恶降临在这城和城中的居民身上，使这城和城中的居民，
在我面前被移走一段时间，我要把这百姓分散在外邦人中间，叫他们向外邦人行善。
我的子民必受责罚，到了他们要寻求时代的繁荣的时候。

\Chapter
\Verse For I have said these things to you that you may bid Jeremiah, and all those that are like you, to retire from this city.
我对你们说这些话，是要叫你们叫耶利米和所有像你们一样的人，从这城中退去。

\Verse For your works are to this city as a firm pillar,
And your prayers as a strong wall.'
因为你们的工作对这城来说，就像坚固的柱子一样。
你的祷告如坚固的墙。'

\Chapter 
\Verse And I said: 'O \LORD, my \LORD, have I come into the world for this purpose that I might see the evils of my mother Not (so) my Lord. 
我说：'耶和华啊，我的主啊，我来到世界上，就是为了这个目的，好让我看见我母亲的罪恶，而不是（如此）我的主。
\Verse If I have found grace in Your sight, first take my spirit that I may go to my fathers and not behold the destruction of my mother. 
我若在你的眼中找到了恩典，就先取我的灵，使我可以到我的祖宗那里去，不要让我看到我母亲的毁灭。
\Verse For two things vehemently constrain me: for I cannot resist you, and my soul, moreover, cannot behold the evils of my mother. 
因为有这两件事使我完全地受制于你：一因为我不能抗拒你，
二且我的灵魂也不能看我母亲的罪恶。
\Verse But one thing I will say in Your presence, O \LORD. 
但有一件事我要在你面前说，主啊，我要在你面前说，
\Verse What, therefore, will there be after these things for if you destroy Your city, and deliver up Your land to those that hate us, how shall the name of Israel be again remembered 
你若毁坏了你的城，把你的地交到那恨我们的人手中，以色列的名将如何再被人记起，
\Verse Or how shall one speak of Your praises or to whom shall that which is in Your law be explained Or shall the world return to its nature of aforetime), and the age revert to primeval silence And shall the multitude of souls be taken away, and the nature of man not again be named And where is all that which you did say regarding us'   
你的名将如何说起你的赞美，你的律法中的事将如何向谁解释，世界将恢复到从前的本性，时代将恢复到原始的寂静，众人的灵魂将被夺去，人的本性将不再被人称颂，你对我们所说的一切话将在哪里？

\Chapter
\Verse And the \LORD said unto me: 'This city shall be delivered up for a time,
 And the people shall be chastened during a time,
 And the world will not be given over to oblivion.
耶和华对我说：'这城必被交出来，直到永远。
'这城必被交出一段时间。民众也要在一段时期内受到责罚。世人也不至于被遗忘。

\Verse [Dost you think that this is that city of which I said: "On the palms of My hands have I graven you" 
你们以为这就是我说的那城吗？"我在我的手掌上刻下了你的名字" 
\Verse This building now built in your midst is not that which is revealed with Me, that which prepared beforehand here from the time when I took counsel to make Paradise, and showed Adam before he sinned, but when he transgressed the commandment it was removed from him, as also Paradise. 
现在建在你们中间的这建筑，不是我与你们中间的那座城，不是我与你们中间的那座城，而是我在亚当犯罪之前，从我出谋划策，制造天堂的时候，就在这里预先预备好的，在亚当犯罪之前，就把它从他身上移走了，也是天堂。
\Verse And after these things I showed it to My servant Abraham by night among the portions of the victims. 
在这事之后，我就在夜里在众人中把它给我的仆人亚伯拉罕看了。
\Verse And again also I showed it to Moses on Mount Sinai when I showed to the likeness of the tabernacle and all its vessels. 
我又在西奈山上向摩西显露了它，当我把帐幕和所有的器皿都显露出来。
\Verse And now, behold, it is preserved with Me, as Paradise. 
 现在，看哪，它与我同存，如同乐园一样。
\Verse Go, therefore, and do as I command you.']
所以你们要去，照我所吩咐的去行。]

\Verse What have they profited who had knowledge before you and have not walked in vanity as the rest of the nations, and have not said to the dead: "Give us life," but always feared you, and have not left Your ways 
在你面前有知识的人，不像其余的民族那样虚荣地行走，不对死人说："给我们生命，却一直敬畏你，不离开你的道路。
\Verse And lo! they have been carried off, nor on their account have you had mercy on Zion. 
别人若作恶，是因锡安
\Verse And if others did evil, it was due to Zion that on account of the works of those who wrought good works she should be forgiven, and should not be overwhelmed on account of the works of those who wrought unrighteousness. 
因行善的人行善的事，就该得赦免，不因行不义的人的事，就该被压倒。
\Verse But who, O \LORD, my \LORD, will comprehend Your judgment,
耶和华啊，我的主啊，谁能明白你的审判呢。

        Or who will search out the profoundness of Your way
        又谁会寻得你的道之深刻？

        Or who will think out the weight of Your path
        又谁会懂得你的道之重要？

\Verse Or who will be able to think out Your incomprehensible counsel
又谁会懂得你的神秘

        Or who of those that are born has ever found
又在世间曾走过的人有几个懂得

        The beginning or end of Your wisdom
你智慧的始终

\Verse For we have all been made like a breath. 
因为我们都是在呼吸的气息中被造出来的。
\Verse  For as the breath ascends involuntarily, and again dies, so it is with the nature of men, who depart not according to their own will, and know not what will befall them in the end. 
人的本性也是如此，不按自己的意思离开，也不知道终究会有什么结果。
\Verse For the righteous justly hope for the end, and without fear depart from this habitation, because they have with you a store of works preserved in treasuries. 
正义的人，因着公义的人盼望着末日，就不惧怕离开这住处，因为他们有存留在库房里的工分。
\Verse On this account also these without fear leave this world, and trusting with joy they hope to receive the world which you have promised them. 
他们也因此离开这世界，无所畏惧，就满心欢喜地信靠你，盼望得到你所应许的世界。
\Verse But as for us—woe to us, who also are now shamefully entreated, and at that time look forward (only) to evils. 
至于我们，我们也是可耻的，现在也是可耻的，在那时候，只顾着往前看（只顾着）罪恶。
\Verse But you know accurately what you have done by means of Your servants; for we are not able to understand that which is good as you art, our Creator. 
但你确切地知道你借着你的仆人所做的事，因为我们不能明白你这造物主，你所行的善，是我们所不能明白的。
\Verse But again I will speak in Your presence, O \LORD, my \LORD. 
但耶和华啊，我的主啊，我要再一次在你面前说。
\Verse When of old there was no world with its inhabitants, you did devise and speak with a word, and forthwith the works of creation stood before you. 
从前世界没有居民的时候，你就用话语设计，说了一句话，造物的事就站在你面前。
\Verse And you did say that you wouldst make for Your world man as the administrator of Your works, that it might be known that he was by no means made on account of the world, but the world on account of him. 
你曾说过，你要为你的世界造人，作你工作的管理人，叫人知道他不是因着世界而造，而是因着他而造的世界。
\Verse And now I see that as for the world which was made on account of us, lo! it abides; but we, on account of whom it was made, depart.'
我现在看见，那因我们而造的世界，还在，但我们因着谁而造的，就离去了。

\Chapter
\Verse And the Lord answered and said unto me: 'You are rightly astonished regarding the departure of man, but you have not judged well regarding the evils which befall those who sin. 
主回答我说：'你对人的离去感到惊奇是对的，但你对那些犯罪的人所受的罪，却没有判断好。
\Verse And as regards what you have said, that the righteous are carried off and the impious are prospered, 
至于你所说的，义人被赶走，不虔诚的人被赶走，不虔诚的人被发扬光大，
\Verse And as regards what you have said: "Man knows not Your judgment "
至于你所说的。"人不知道你的审判"，
\Verse —On this account hear, and I will speak to you, and hearken, and I will cause you to hear My words. 
你要听，我就对你说，你要听，我就使你听，我就使你听我的话。
\Verse Man would not rightly have understood My judgment, unless he had accepted the law, and I had instructed him in understanding. 
人若不接受我的律法，我又指示他明白我的判断，他就不会明白我的判断。
\Verse But now, because he transgressed wittingly, yea, just on this ground that he knows (about it), he shall be tormented.
但现在，因为他故意犯了罪，是的，就因为他知道这一点，他就必受折磨。

\Verse And as regards what you did say touching the righteous, that on account of them has this world come, so also again shall that, which is to come, come on their account. 
至于你所说的关于义人的事，今世因着他们的缘故而来，将来要来的也要因着他们的缘故而来。
\Verse For this world is to them a strife and a labor with much trouble; and that accordingly which is to come, a crown with great glory.'
因为这世界对他们来说，是有许多的争战和劳苦，而那要来的，也是有大荣耀的冠冕。

\Chapter
\Verse  And I answered and said: '0 LORD, my Lord, lo! the years of this time are few and evil, and who is able in his little time to acquire that which is measureless'
我回答说：“啊，\神 啊！呜呼！
这个时代的岁月不多而且是邪恶的，谁能在他那微不足道的时间里，获得无量的东西？

\Chapter
\Verse And the Lord answered and said unto me: 'With the Most High account is not taken of time nor of a few years. 
耶和华回答我说：'在至高者那里，不以时间为数，也不以年数为数。
\Verse For what did it profit Adam that he lived nine hundred and thirty years and transgressed that which he was commanded Therefore the multitude of time that he lived did not profit him, but brought death and cut off the years of those who were born from him. wherein did Moses suffer loss in that he lived only one hundred and twenty years, and, inasmuch he was subject to Him who formed him, brought the law to the seed of Jacob, and lighted a lamp for the nation of Israel'
亚当活了九百三十年，犯了所吩咐的事，有什么好处呢。所以，他活了九百三十年，所活的时间多了，不但没有好处，反而使他死了，使从他生的人的年限断了。
摩西只活了一百二十岁，就在其中受了损失，因为他只活了一百二十岁，就在他受制于形成他、将律法带给雅各的后裔、为以色列国点亮了一盏灯的时候，他就受了损失。

\Chapter
\Verse  And I answered and said: 'He that lighted has taken from the light, and there are but few that have imitated him. But those many whom he has lighted have taken from the darkness of Adam and have not rejoiced in the light of the lamp.' 
我回答说：'那点灯的人从光中取走了，仿效他的人不多。但他所点燃的人中，有许多人是从亚当的黑暗中取来的，没有因灯的光而欢喜。

\Chapter
\Verse  And He answered and said unto me: 'Wherefore at that time he appointed for them a covenant and said:
 他回答我说："所以当时他为他们立了一个约，说：'看哪，我把生死放在你们面前。

        "Behold I have placed before you life and death,"
		看哪，我已把生死放在你们面前。

        And he called heaven and earth to witness against them.
		他召来了天和地，让他们作见证。

\Verse For he knew that his time was but short,
因为他知道，他的时间很短。

        But that heaven and earth endure always.
        但是，天和地永存。

\Verse        But after his death they sinned and transgressed,
但在他死后，他们就犯罪了，越了规。

        Though they knew that they had the law reproving (them),
		虽然他们知道，他们有法律的责备（他们）。

        And the light in which nothing could err,
		还有那道光，没有任何东西会出错。

        Also the spheres which testify, and Me.
		还有那见证的星辰，和我。

\Verse  Now regarding everything that is, it is I that judge, but do not you take counsel in your soul regarding these things, nor afflict thyself because of those which have been. 
现在，凡属我的事，是我在审判，但你不要在你的灵魂里为这些事作议论，也不要因过去的事而自责。
\Verse For now it is the consummation of time that should be considered, whether of business, or of prosperity, or of shame and not the beginning thereof. 
因为现在要看时间的长短，不管是事业的兴旺，还是荣华富贵，或者是耻辱，都要看时间的长短，而不是时间的开始。
\Verse Because if a man be prospered in his beginnings and shamefully entreated in his old age, he forgets all the prosperity that he had. 
因为人若是初时兴旺，年老时可耻地受人欺负，就忘记了他曾经的一切兴旺。
\Verse And again, if a man is shamefully entreated in his beginnings, and at his end is prospered, he remembers not again his evil entreatment. 
又说，人若是初时受了可耻的盘缠，到了晚年却得了丰盛，就不记得自己的恶行了。
\Verse And again hearken: though each one were prospered all that time—all the time from the day on which death was decreed against those who transgress—and in his end was destroyed, in vain would have been everything.'
你要再听着，从那日起，各人虽然一直都是富足的，但从那日起，死亡的人被判处死刑，到最后被消灭，一切的一切都是徒然的。

\Chapter 
\Verse And when I had said these things I fell asleep there, and I saw a vision in the night. 
當我說了這些話後，我就在那裏睡著了，我在夜裏看到一個異象。
\Verse And lo! a forest of trees planted on the plain, and lofty and rugged rocky mountains surrounded it, and that forest occupied much space. 
在平原上有一片樹林，周圍有高大的山峰，那樹林佔了許多地方。
\Verse And lo! over against it arose a vine, and from under it there went forth a fountain peacefully. 
有一棵藤蔓，在它的上方，有一棵葡萄树，从它的下面，有一个泉眼静静地流出来。
\Verse Now that fountain came to the forest and was (stirred) into great waves, and those waves submerged that forest, and suddenly they rooted out the greater part of that forest, and overthrew all the mountains which were round about it. 
那噴泉到了那林子裡，被激起了大浪，那些浪頭淹沒了那林子，忽然把那林子的大部份連根拔起，把四周的山都推倒了。
\Verse And the height of the forest began to be made low, and the top of the mountains was made low and that fountain prevailed greatly, so that it left nothing of that great forest save one cedar only. 
森林的高度开始变低，山的顶端也变低了，山的顶端也变低了，那泉眼大盛，使那大森林只剩下一棵雪松。
\Verse Also when it had cast it down and had destroyed and rooted out the greater part of that forest, so that nothing was left of it, nor could its place be recognized, then that vine began to come with the fountain in peace and great tranquility, and it came to a place which was not far from that cedar, and they brought the cedar which had been cast down to it. 
当它把那森林的大部分都毁坏了，并把它连根拔起，使它什么都不剩，也不能认出它的位置。这时，那藤蔓开始带着喷泉来了，它来到离那棵雪松不远的地方，他们把投下的雪松带到了那里。
\Verse And I beheld and lo! that vine opened its mouth and spoke and said to that cedar: Art you not that cedar which was left of the forest of wickedness, and by whose means wickedness persisted, and was wrought all those years, and goodness never. 
我看见了，那葡萄树张开嘴，对那雪松说："你不就是那棵雪松吗？ 邪恶的森林里留下的那棵雪松吗？
邪恶的手段一直存在，这些年来，邪恶一直在被破坏，而善良从来没有被破坏。
\Verse And you kept conquering that which was not yours, and to that which was your you did never show compassion, and you did keep extending your power over those who were far from you, and those who drew near you, you did hold fast in the toils of your wickedness, and you did uplift thyself always as one that could not be rooted out! 
你不斷地征服那不屬於你的，對於那屬於你的，你從來沒有表現出憐憫，你不斷地把你的力量伸向那些遠離你的人，和那些接近你的人，你在你的惡行中堅守著，你總是把自己當作不能被根除的人而奮起來。
\Verse But now your time has sped and your hour is come. 
但现在你的时间已经过去了，你的时候到了。
\Verse Do you also therefore depart, O cedar, after the forest, which departed before you, and become dust with it, and let your ashes be mingled together. 
雪松啊，你也要离去吧，雪松啊，在你之前离去的森林之后，和它一起成为尘土，让你的灰烬混在一起。
\Verse And now recline in anguish and rest in torment till your last time come, in which you will come again, and be tormented still more.'
现在你要在痛苦中躺下，在苦难中休息，直到你最后的时候来，你要再来，受更多的折磨。


\Chapter And after these things I saw that cedar burning, and the vine growing, itself and all around it, the plain full of unfading flowers. And I indeed awoke and arose.
做完这些事后，我看到那棵雪松在燃烧，藤蔓在生长，它自己和周围的一切，平原上开满了不褪色的花。我果然醒了，醒了过来。

\Verse And by it the truth will be hidden, and all those who are polluted with iniquity will flee to it, as evil beasts flee and creep into the forest. 
真理必被它隐藏起来，所有被不义污染的人都要逃到它那里去，就像恶兽逃到森林里去，匍匐前进。

\Verse And as touching that which you have seen, the lofty cedar, which was left of that forest, and the fact, that the vine spoke those words with it which you did hear, this is the word.
说起你所看到的，说起你所看到的，说起那片林子里残留的高大的雪松，说起你听到的那句话的藤蔓，这就是那句话。

\Verse The last leader of that time will be left alive, when the multitude of his hosts will be put to the sword, and he will be bound, and they will take him up to Mount Zion, and My Messiah will convict him of all his impieties, and will gather and set before him all the works of his hosts. 
那时候，最后的领袖必被活捉，当他的众人被钉死在剑上，他将被捆绑起来，带他上锡安山，我的弥赛亚要将他的一切罪孽定罪，并将他的众人的行为都聚集在他面前。
\Verse And afterwards he will put him to death, and protect the rest of My people which shall be found in the place which I have chosen. 
然后，他要把他处死，保护我所选的地方，我的子民中的其他人。
\Verse And his principate will stand for ever, until the world of corruption is at an end, and until the times aforesaid are fulfilled.
他的主将永远站在那里，直到堕落的世界结束，直到上述的时代实现。

And write in the remembrance of your heart all that you shall learn.

\Verse        For the earth shall then assuredly restore the dead,

But as it has received, so shall it restore them,

\Verse For then it will be necessary to show the living that the dead have come to life again, and that those who had departed have returned (again).
因為到了那時候，要讓活人知道，死人又復活了，離去的人又回來了。
\Verse And it shall come to pass, when they have severally recognized those whom they now know, then judgment shall grow strong, and those things which before were spoken of shall come.
當他們認清了他們現在所認識的人的時候，審判就必增長起來，以前所說的事也必來了。

\Chapter 
\Verse And it shall come to pass, when that appointed day has gone by, that then shall the aspect of those who are condemned be afterwards changed, and the glory of those who are justified. 
當那指定的日子過了，那被定罪的人的面目要變了，被稱義的人的榮耀也要變了。
\Verse For the aspect of those who now act wickedly shall become worse than it is, as they shall suffer torment. 
因为那些现在行恶的人的面目要比现在更坏，因为他们要受折磨。
\Verse Also (as for) the glory of those who have now been justified in My law, who have had understanding in their life, and who have planted in their heart the root of wisdom, then their splendor shall be glorified in changes, and the form of their face shall be turned into the light of their beauty, that they may be able to acquire and receive the world which does not die, which is then promised to them. 
至於那些在我的律法中稱職的人，他們的榮耀，他們的生命有了理解，在他們的心中種下了智慧的根，他們的榮耀必在變化中得到榮耀，他們的面孔的形狀必變成他們的光，使他們能得到和接受那不死的世界，那是應許給他們的。
\Verse For over this above all shall those who come then lament, that they rejected My law, and stopped their ears that they might not hear wisdom or receive understanding. 
因為那來的人，必在這上面哀嘆，因為他們拒絕了我的律法，停止了他們的耳朵，使他們不能聽到智慧，不能得到理解。
\Verse When therefore they see those, over whom they are now exalted, (but) who shall then be exalted and glorified more than they, they shall respectively be transformed, the latter into the splendor of angels, and the former shall yet more waste away in wonder at the visions and in the beholding of the forms. 
当他们看见那些现在被尊崇的人，他们现在被尊崇的人，后来又被尊崇的人，比他们更荣耀的人，他们必分别被改变，后者变成天使的光辉，前者必在异象和看形体的时候，更要在惊奇中消逝。

          And wisdom a confidence,
智慧也是一种自信。

          Shall wonders appear in their time.

因为他们要看到现在他们看不见的世界。 

          And they shall behold the time which is now hidden from them:
他们要看清时间，这时间已从他们身上隐去了。

\Verse        And time shall no longer age them.
时间将不再使他们衰老.

\Verse      For in the heights of that world shall they dwell,
因为在那世界的高处，他们必住在那里,

          And they shall be made like unto the angels,
他们将像天使一样被制造出来。

          And be made equal to the stars,
并使之与众星平等。

          And they shall be changed into every form they desire,

\Verse For there shall be spread before them the extents of Paradise, and there shall be shown to them the beauty of the majesty of the living creatures which are beneath the throne, and all the armies of the angels, who are now held fast by My word, lest they should appear, and] are held fast by a command, that they may stand in their places till their advent comes. 
因為樂園的範圍必在他們面前擴張，在他們面前，必向他們顯現在寶座下的活物的威嚴之美，以及所有的天使的軍隊，都因我的話而堅守，免得他們顯現，又因命令而堅守，使他們在原地站立，直到他們的降臨。
\Verse Moreover, there shall then be excellency in the righteous surpassing that in the angels. 
而且，那时候，义人的尊贵必超过天使的尊贵。
\Verse For the first shall receive the last, those whom they were expecting, and the last those of whom they used to hear that they had passed away.
因为他们所盼望的人，先来的人要接待最后的人，最后的人要接待他们所盼望的人，他们常听说他们已经去世的人。

\Verse      For they have been delivered from this world of tribulation,

          And laid down the burthen of anguish.


\Verse      For what then have men lost their life,

          And for what have those who were on the earth exchanged their soul


\Verse      For then they chose (not) for themselves this time,

          Which, beyond the reach of anguish, could not pass away:

          But they chose for themselves that time,

          Whose issues are full of lamentations and evils,

          And they denied the world which ages not those who come to it,

          And they rejected the time of glory,

          So that they shall not come to the honor of which I told you before.'

\Chapter 
\Verse And I answered and said:

'How can we forget those for whom woe is then reserved


\Verse        And why therefore do we again mourn for those who die

          Or why do we weep for those who depart to Sheol


\Verse        Let lamentations be reserved for the beginning of that coming torment,

          And let tears be laid up for the advent of the destruction of that time.


\Verse        [But even in the face of these things will I speak.


\Verse        And as for the righteous, what will they do now


\Verse        Rejoice you in the suffering which you now suffer:

          For why do you look for the decline of your enemies


\Verse        Make ready your soul for that which is reserved for you,

And prepare your souls for the reward which is laid up for you.']

53—54. THE MESSIAH APOCALYPSE

53. The Vision of the Cloud with black and white Waters

\Chapter 
\Verse And when I had said these things I fell asleep there, and I saw a vision, and lo! a cloud was ascending from a very great sea, and I kept gazing upon it) and lo! it was full of waters white and black, and there were many colors in those self-same waters, and as it were the likeness of great lightning was seen at its summit. 
\Verse And I saw the cloud passing swiftly in quick courses, and it covered all the earth. 
\Verse And it came to pass after these things that that cloud began to pour upon the earth the waters that were in it. 
\Verse And I saw that there was not one and the same likeness in the waters which descended from it. 
\Verse For in the first beginning they were black and many (Or a time, and afterwards I saw that the waters became bright, but they were not many, and after these things again I saw black (waters), and after these things again bright, and again black and again bright. 
\Verse Now this was done twelve times, but the black were always more numerous than the bright.
\Verse And it came to pass at the end of the cloud, that lo! it rained black waters, and they were darker than had been all those waters that were before, and fire was mingled with them, and where those waters descended, they wrought devastation and destruction. 
\Verse And after these things I saw how that lightning which I had seen on the summit of the cloud, seized hold of it and hurled it to the earth. 
\Verse Now that lightning shone exceedingly, so as to illuminate the whole earth, and it healed those regions where the last waters had descended and wrought devastation. 
\Verse And it took hold of the whole earth, and had dominion over it. 
\Verse And I saw after these things, and lo! twelve rivers were ascending from the sea, and they began to surround that lightning and to become subject to it. 
\Verse And by reason of my fear I awoke.

54—55. Baruch's Prayer for an Interpretation of  the Vision: Ramiel's advent for

this Purpose

\Chapter 
\Verse And I besought the Mighty One, and said:

'You alone, O Lord, know of aforetime the deep things of the world,

And the things which befall in their times You bring about by Your word, And against the works of the inhabitants of the earth you do hasten the beginnings of the times,

And the end of the seasons you alone know.


\Verse        (You) for whom nothing is too hard,

But who do everything easily by a nod:


\Verse        (You) to whom the depths come as the heights,

And whose word the beginnings of the ages serve:


\Verse        (You) who reveal to those who fear you what is prepared for them,

That thenceforth they may be comforted.


\Verse        You show great acts to those who know not;

You break up the enclosure of those who are ignorant,

And lightest up what is dark,

And reveal what is hidden to the pure,

[Who in faith have submitted themselves to you and Your law.]


\Verse        You have shown to Your servant this vision;

Reveal to me also its interpretation.


\Verse        For I know that as regards those things wherein I besought you, I have received a response,

And as regards what I besought, you did reveal to me with what voice I should praise you,

And from what members I should cause praises and hallelujahs to ascend to you.


\Verse        For if my members were mouths,

And the hairs of my head voices,

Even so I could not give you the reward of praise,

Nor laud you as is befitting,

Nor could I recount Your praise,

Nor tell the glory of Your beauty.


\Verse        For what am I amongst men,

Or why am I reckoned amongst those who are more excellent than I,

That I have heard all these marvelous things from the Most High,

And numberless promises from Him who created me

\Verse      Blessed be my mother among those that bear,

And praised among women be she that bare me.

\Verse      For I will not be silent in praising the Mighty One,

And with the voice of praise I will recount His marvelous deeds.

\Verse      For who doeth like unto Your marvelous deeds, O God,

Or who comprehend Your deep thought of life.

\Verse      For with Your counsel you do govern all the creatures which Your right  hand has created

And you have established every fountain of light beside you,

And the treasures of wisdom beneath Your throne have you prepared.

\Verse      And justly do they perish who have not loved Your law,

And the torment of judgment shall await those who have not submitted themselves to Your power.

\Verse      For though Adam first sinned

And brought untimely death upon all,

Yet of those who were born from him

Each one of them has prepared for his own soul torment to come,

And again each one of them has chosen for himself glories to come.

\Verse      [For assuredly he who believeth will receive reward.

\Verse      But now, as for you, you wicked that now are, turn you to destruction, because you shall speedily be visited, in that formerly you rejected the understanding of the Most High.

\Verse      For His works have not taught you,

Nor has the skill of His creation which is at all times persuaded you.]

\Verse      Adam is therefore not the cause, save only of his own soul,

But each of us has been the Adam of his own soul.

\Verse      But do You, O Lord, expound to me regarding those things which you have revealed to me,

And inform me regarding that which I besought you.

\Verse      For at the consummation of the world vengeance shall be taken upon those who have done wickedness according to their wickedness,

And you will glorify the faithful according to their faithfulness.

\Verse      For those who are amongst your own you rule,

And those who sin you blot out from amongst your own.'

\Chapter 
\Verse And it came to pass when I had finished speaking the words of this prayer, that I sat there under a tree, that I might rest in the shade of the branches. 
\Verse And I wondered and was astonished, and pondered in my thoughts regarding the multitude of goodness which sinners who are upon the earth have rejected, and regarding the great torment which they have despised, though they knew that they should be tormented because of the sin they had committed. 
\Verse And when I was pondering on these things and the like, lo! the angel Ramiel who presides over true visions was sent to me, and he said unto me:

\Verse        'Why does your heart trouble you, Baruch,

and why does your thought disturb you

\Verse        For if owing to the report which you have only heard of judgment you are so moved,

What (wilt you be) when you shall see it manifestly with your eyes

\Verse        And if with the expectation wherewith you do expect the day of the Mighty One you are so overcome,

What (wilt you be) when you shall come to its advent

\Verse       And, if at the word of the announcement of the torment of those who have done foolishly you are so wholly distraught,

How much more when the event will reveal marvelous things

\Verse        And if you have heard tidings of the good and evil things which are then coming and are grieved,

What (wilt you be) when you shall behold what the majesty will reveal, Which shall convict these and cause those to rejoice.'

56—74. Interpretation of the Vision. The black and bright Waters symbolize the World's History from Adam to the Advent of the Messiah.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'Nevertheless, because you have besought the Most High to reveal to you the interpretation of the vision which you have seen, I have been sent to tell you. 
\Verse And the Mighty One hath assuredly made known to you the methods of the times that have passed, and of those that are destined to pass in His world from the beginning of its creation even unto its consummation, of those things which (are) deceit and of those which (are) in truth. 
\Verse For as you did see a great cloud which ascended from the sea, and went and covered the earth, this is the duration of the world (= a) which the Mighty One made when he took counsel to make the world. 
\Verse And it came to pass when the word had gone forth from His presence, that the duration of the world had come into being in a small degree, and was established according to the multitude of the intelligence of Him who sent it. 
\Verse And as you did previously see on the summit of the cloud black waters which descended previously on the earth, this is the transgression wherewith Adam the first man transgressed.


\Verse        For [since] when he transgressed

Untimely death came into being,

Grief was named

And anguish was prepared,

And pain was created,

And trouble consummated,

And disease began to be established,

And Sheol kept demanding that it should be renewed in blood,

And the begetting of children was brought about,

And the passion of parents produced,

And the greatness of humanity was humiliated,

And goodness languished.


\Verse What therefore can be blacker or darker than these things 
\Verse This is the beginning of the black waters which you have seen. 
\Verse And from these black (waters) again were black derived, and the darkness of darkness was produced. 
\Verse For he became a danger to his own soul: even to the angels 
\Verse For, moreover, at that time when he was created, they enjoyed liberty. 
\Verse And became he a danger some of them descended, and mingled with the women. 
\Verse And then those who did so were tormented in chains. 
\Verse But the rest of the multitude of the angels, of which there is (no) number, restrained themselves. 15 And those who dwelt on the earth perished together (with them) through the waters of the deluge. 16 These are the black first waters.

\Chapter 
\Verse And after these (waters) you did see bright waters: this is the fount of Abraham, also his generations and advent of his son, and of his son's son, and of those like them. 
\Verse Because at that time the unwritten law was named amongst them,

And the works of the commandments were then fulfilled,

And belief in the coming judgment was then generated,

And hope of the world that was to be renewed was then built up,

And the promise of the life that should come hereafter was implanted.


\Verse        These are the bright waters, which you have seen.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'And the black third waters which you have seen, these are the mingling of all sins, which the nations afterwards wrought after the death of those righteous men, and the wickedness of the land of Egypt, wherein they did wickedly in the service wherewith they made their sons to serve. 
\Verse Nevertheless, these also perished at last.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'And the bright fourth waters which you have seen are the advent of Moses and Aaron and Miriam and Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb and of all those like them. 
\Verse For at that time the lamp of the eternal law shone on all those who sat in darkness, which announced to them that believe the promise of their reward, and to them that deny, the torment of fire which is reserved for them. 
\Verse But also the heavens at that time were shaken from their place, and those who were under the throne of the Mighty One were perturbed, when He was taking Moses unto Himself. 
\Verse For He showed him many admonitions together with the principles of the law and the consummation of the times, as also to you, and likewise the pattern of Zion and its measures, in the pattern of which the sanctuary of the present time was to be made. 
\Verse But then also He showed to him the measures of the fire, also the depths of the abyss, and the weight of the winds, and the number of the drops of rain: 
\Verse And the suppression of anger, and the multitude of long-suffering, and the truth of judgment: 
\Verse And the root of wisdom, and the riches of understanding, and the fount of knowledge: 
\Verse And the height of the air, and the greatness of Paradise, and the consummation of the ages, and the beginning of the day of judgment: 
\Verse And the number of the offerings, and the earths which have not yet come: 
\Verse And the mouth of Gehenna, and the station of vengeance, and the place of faith, and the region of hope: 
\Verse And the likeness of future torment, and the multitude of innumerable angels, and the flaming hosts, and the splendor of the lightnings, and the voice of the thunders, and the orders of the chiefs of the angels, and the treasuries of light, and the changes of the times, and the investigations of the law. 
\Verse These are the bright fourth waters which you have seen.

\Chapter 
\Verse And the black fifth waters which you have seen raining are the works which the Amorites wrought, and the spells of their incantations which they wrought, and the wickedness of their mysteries, and the mingling of their pollution. 
\Verse But even Israel was then polluted by sins in the days of the judges, though they saw many signs which were from Him who made them.

\Chapter 
\Verse And the bright sixth waters which thru did see, this is the time in which David and Solomon were born.


\Verse        And there was at that time the building of Zion,

And the dedication of the sanctuary,

          And the shedding of much blood of the nations that sinned then,

And many offerings which were offered then in the dedication of the sanctuary.


\Verse        And peace and tranquility existed at that time,


\Verse        And wisdom was heard in the assembly:

          And the riches of understanding were magnified in the congregations,


\Verse        And the holy festivals were fulfilled in blessedness and in much joy.


\Verse        And the judgment of the rulers was then seen to be without guile,

And the righteousness of the precepts of the Mighty One was accomplished with truth.


\Verse        And the land [which] was then beloved by the Lord,

And because its inhabitants sinned not, it was glorified beyond all lands, And the city Zion ruled then over all lands and regions.


\Verse        These are the bright waters which you have seen.

\Chapter 
\Verse And the black seventh waters which you have seen, this is the perversion (brought about) by the counsel of Jeroboam, who took counsel to make two calves of gold: 
\Verse And all the iniquities which kings who were after him iniquitously wrought. 
\Verse And the curse of Jezebel and the worship of idols which Israel practiced at that time. 
\Verse And the withholding of rain, and the famines which occurred until women eat the fruit of their wombs. 
\Verse And the time of their captivity which came upon the nine tribes and a half, because they were in many sins. 
\Verse And Shalmanezzar king of Assyria came and led them away captive. 
\Verse But regarding the Gentiles it were tedious to tell how they always wrought impiety and wickedness, and never wrought righteousness. 
\Verse These are the black seventh waters which you have seen.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'And the bright eighth waters which you have seen, this is the rectitude and uprightness of Hezekiah king of Judah and the grace (of God) which came upon him. 
\Verse For when Sennacherib was stirred up in order that he might perish, and his wrath troubled him in order that he might thereby perish, for the multitude also of the nations which were with him. 
\Verse When, moreover, Hezekiah the king heard those things which the king of Assyria was devising, (i.e.) to come and seize him and destroy his people, the two and a half tribes which remained: nay, more he wished to overthrow Zion also: then Hezekiah trusted in his works, and had hope in his righteousness, and spoke with the Mighty One and said: 
\Verse "Behold, for lo! Sennacherib is prepared to destroy us, and he will be boastful and uplifted when he has destroyed Zion."


\Verse        And the Mighty One heard him, for Hezekiah was wise,

And He had respect unto his prayer, because he was righteous.


\Verse And thereupon the Mighty One commanded Ramiel His angel who speaks with you. 
\Verse And I went forth and destroyed their multitude, the number of whose chiefs only was a hundred and eighty-five thousand, and each one of them had an equal number (at his command). 
\Verse And at that time I burned their bodies within, but their raiment and arms I preserved outwardly, in order that the still more wonderful deeds of the Mighty One might appear, and that thereby His name might be spoken of throughout the whole earth. 
\Verse And Zion was saved and Jerusalem delivered: Israel also was freed from tribulation. 
\Verse And all those who were in the holy land  rejoiced, and the name of the Mighty One was glorified so that it was spoken of 
\Verse These are the bright waters which you have seen.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'And the black ninth waters which you have seen, this is all the wickedness which was in the days of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah. 
\Verse For he wrought much impiety, and he slew the righteous, and he wrested judgment, and he shed the blood of the innocent, and wedded women he violently polluted, and he overturned the altars, and destroyed their offerings, and drove forth their priests lest they should minister in the sanctuary. 
\Verse And he made an image with five faces: four of them looked to the four winds, and the fifth on the summit of the image as ah adversary of the zeal of the Mighty One. 
\Verse And then wrath went forth from the presence of the Mighty One to the intent that Zion should be rooted out, as also it befell in your days. But also against the two tribes and a half went forth a decree that they should also be led away captive, as you have now seen. 
\Verse And to such a degree did the impiety of Manasseh increase, that it removed the praise of the Most High from the sanctuary. 
\Verse On this account Manasseh was at that time named 'the impious," and finally his abode was in the fire. 
\Verse For though his prayer was heard with the Most High, finally, when he was cast into the brazen horse and the brazen horse was melted, it served as a sign unto him for the hour. 
\Verse For he had not lived perfectly, for he was not worthy—but that thenceforward he might know by whom finally he should be tormented. 
\Verse For he who is able to benefit is also able to torment.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'Thus, moreover, did Manasseh act impiously, and thought that in his time the Mighty One would not inquire into these things. 
\Verse These are the black ninth waters which you have seen.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'And the bright tenth waters which you have seen: this is the purity of the generations of Josiah king of Judah, who was the only one at the time who submitted himself to the Mighty One with all his heart and with all his soul. 
\Verse And he cleansed the land from idols, and hallowed all the vessels which had been polluted, and restored the offerings to the altar, and raised the horn of the holy, and exalted the righteous, and honored all that were wise in understanding, and brought back the priests to their ministry, and destroyed and removed the magicians and enchanters and necromancers from the land. 
\Verse And not only did he slay the impious that were living, but they also took from the sepulchers the bones of the dead and burned them with fire. 
\Verse [And the festivals and the Sabbaths he established in their sanctity], and their polluted ones he burnt in the fire, and the lying prophets which deceived the people, these also he burnt in the fire, and the people who listened to them when they were living, he cast them into the brook Kidron, and heaped stones upon them. 
\Verse And he was zealous with zeal for the Mighty One with all his soul, and he alone was firm in the law at that time, so that he left none that was uncircumcised, or that wrought impiety in all the land, all the days of his life. 
\Verse Therefore he shall receive an eternal reward, and he shall be glorified with the Mighty One beyond many at a later time. 
\Verse For on his account and on account of those who are like him were the honorable glories, of which you were told before, created and prepared. These arc the bright waters which you have seen.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'And the black eleventh waters which you have seen: this is the calamity which is now befalling "Zion.


\Verse        Do you think that there is no anguish to the angels in the presence of the Mighty One,

That Zion was so delivered up,

And that lo! the Gentiles boast in their hearts,

And assemble before their idols and say,

          "She is trodden down who oftentimes trod down,

And she has been reduced to servitude who reduced (others)"


\Verse        Dost you think that in these things the Most High rejoices,

Or that His name is glorified


\Verse        [But how will it serve towards His righteous judgment]


\Verse        Yet after these things shall the dispersed among the Gentiles be taken hold of by tribulation,

And in shame shall they dwell in every place.


\Verse        Because so far as Zion is delivered up

And Jerusalem laid waste,

Shall idols prosper in the cities of the Gentiles,

And the vapor of the smoke of the incense of the righteousness which is by the law is extinguished in Zion,

And in the region of Zion in every place lo! there is the smoke of impiety.


\Verse        But the king of Babylon will arise who has now destroyed Zion,

And he will boast over the people,

And he will speak great things in his heart in the presence of the Most High.


\Verse        But he also shall fall at last. These are the black waters.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'And the bright twelfth waters which you have seen: this is the word. 
\Verse For after these things time will come when your people shall fall into distress, so that they shall all run the risk of perishing together. 
\Verse Nevertheless, they will be saved, and their enemies will fall in their presence. 
\Verse And they will have in (due) time much joy. 
\Verse And at that time after a little interval Zion will again be rebuilt, and its offerings will again be restored, and the priests will return to their ministry, and also the Gentiles will come to glorify it. 
\Verse Nevertheless, not fully as in the beginning. 
\Verse But it will come to pass after these things that there will be the fall of many nations. 
\Verse These are the bright waters which you have seen.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'For the last waters which you have seen which were darker than all that were before them, those which were after the twelfth number, which were collected together, belong to the whole world. 
\Verse For the Most High made division from the beginning, because He alone knows what will befall. 
\Verse For as to the enormities and the impieties which should be wrought before Him, He foresaw six kinds of them. 
\Verse And of the good works of the righteous which should be accomplished before Him, He foresaw six kinds of them, beyond those which He should work at the consummation of the age. 
\Verse On his account there were not black waters with black, nor bright with bright; for it is the consummation.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'Hear therefore the interpretation of the last black waters which are to come [after the black]: this the word. 
\Verse Behold! the days come, and it shall be when the time of the age has ripened,

And the harvest of its evil and good seeds has come,

That the Mighty One will bring upon the earth and its inhabitants and upon its rulers

Perturbation of spirit and stupor of heart.


\Verse        And they shall hate one another,

And provoke one another to fight,

And the mean shall rule over the honorable,

And those of low degree shall be extolled above the famous.


\Verse        And the many shall be delivered into the hands of the few,

And those who were nothing shall rule over the strong,

And the poor shall have abundance beyond the rich,

And the impious shall exalt themselves above the heroic.


\Verse       And the wise shall be silent,

And the foolish shall speak,

Neither shall the thought of men be then confirmed,

Nor the counsel of the mighty,

Nor shall the hope of those who hope be confirmed.


\Verse        And when those things which were predicted have come to pass,

Then shall confusion fall upon all men,

And some of them shall fall in battle,

And some of them shall perish in anguish,


\Verse And some of them shall be destroyed by their own. Then the Most High peoples whom He has prepared before,

And they shall come and make war with the leaders that shall then be left.


\Verse        And it shall come to pass that whoever gets safe out of the war shall die in the earthquake,

And whoever gets safe out of the earthquake shall be burned by the fire,

And whoever gets safe out of the fire shall be destroyed by famine.


\Verse [And it shall come to pass that whoever of the victors and the vanquished gets safe out of and escapes all these things aforesaid will be delivered into the hands of My servant Messiah.] 10 For all the earth shall devour its inhabitants.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'And the holy land shall have mercy on its own, And it shall protect its inhabitants at that time. 
\Verse This is the vision which you have seen, and this is the interpretation. 
\Verse For I have come to tell you these things, because your prayer has been heard with the Most High.

\Chapter 
\Verse 'Hear now also regarding the bright lightning which is to come at the consummation after these black (waters): this is the word. 
\Verse After the signs have come, of which you were told before, when the nations become turbulent, and the time of My Messiah is come, he shall both summon all the nations, and some of them he shall spare, and some of them he shall slay. 
\Verse These things therefore shall come upon the nations which are to be spared by Him. 
\Verse Every nation, which knows not Israel and has not trodden down the seed of Jacob, shall indeed be spared. 
\Verse And this because some out of every nation shall be subjected to your people. 
\Verse But all those who have ruled over you, or have known you, shall be given up to the sword.

\Chapter 
\Verse   'And it shall come to pass, when He has brought low everything that is in the world,

And has sat down in peace for the age on the throne of His kingdom,

That joy shall then be revealed,

And rest shall appear.


\Verse        And then healing shall descend in dew,

And disease shall withdraw,

And anxiety and anguish and lamentation pass from amongst men,

And gladness proceed through the whole earth.


\Verse        And no one shall again die untimely,

Nor shall any adversity suddenly befall.


\Verse        And judgments, and abusive talk, and contentions, and revenges,

And blood, and passions, and envy, and hatred,

And whatsoever things are like these shall go into condemnation when they are removed.


\Verse        For it is these very things which have filled this world with evils,

And on account of these the life of man has been greatly troubled.


\Verse        And wild beasts shall come from the forest and minister unto men

And asps and dragons shall come forth from their holes to submit themselves to a little child.


\Verse        And women shall no longer then have pain when they bear,

Nor shall they suffer torment when they yield the fruit of the womb.

\Chapter 
\Verse   'And it shall come to pass in those days that the reapers shall not grow weary,

Nor those that build be toil-worn;

For the works shall of themselves speedily advance

Together with those who do them in much tranquility.


\Verse        For that time is the consummation of that which is corruptible,

And the beginning of that which is not corruptible.


\Verse        Therefore those things which were predicted shall belong to it:

Therefore it is far away from evils, and near to those things which die not.


\Verse        This is the bright lightning which came after the last dark waters.'

75. Baruch's Hymn on the Unsearchableness of God's Ways and on His Mercies  through which the Faithful shall attain to a blessed Consummation
\par

\Chapter 
\Verse   And I answered and said:

'Who can understand, O Lord, Your goodness

For it is incomprehensible.


\Verse        Or who can search into your compassions,

Which are infinite


\Verse        Or who can comprehend Your intelligence


\Verse        Or who is able to recount the thoughts of Your mind


\Verse        Or who of those who are born can hope to come to those things,

Unless he is one to whom you are merciful and gracious


\Verse        Because, if assuredly you did not have compassion on man,

Those who are under Your right hand,

They could not come to those things,

But those who are in the numbers named can be called.


\Verse        But if, indeed, we who exist know wherefore we have come,

And submit ourselves to Him who brought us out of Egypt,

We shall come again and remember those things which have passed,

And shall rejoice regarding that which has been.


\Verse        But if now we know not wherefore we have come,

And recognize not the principate of Him who brought us up out of Egypt, We shall come again and seek after those things which have been now,

And be grieved with pain because of those things which have befallen.'

76. Baruch bidden to instruct the People for forty days and then to hold himself ready for his Assumption on the Advent of the Messiah
\par

\Chapter 
\Verse And He answered and said unto me: ['Inasmuch as the revelation of this vision has been interpreted to you as you requested], hear the word of the Most High that you may know what is to befall you after these things.
\Verse For you shall surely depart from this earth, nevertheless not unto death, but you shall be preserved unto the consummation of the times. 
\Verse Go up therefore to the top of that mountain, and there shall pass before you all the regions of that land, and the figure of the inhabited world, and the top(s) of the mountains, and the depth(s) of the valleys, and the depths of the seas, and the number of the rivers, that you may see what you are leaving, and whither you are going. 
\Verse Now this shall befall after forty days. Go now therefore during these days and instruct the people so far as you are able, that they may learn so as not to die at the last time, but may learn in order that they may live at the last times.'

77. Baruch's Admonition to the People and his writing of two Letters—one to the nine and a half tribes in Assyria and the other to the two and a half in Babylon

\Chapter 
\Verse And I, Baruch, went there and came to the people, and assembled them together from the greatest to the least, and said unto them: 
\Verse 'Hear, you children of Israel, behold how many you are who remain of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
\Verse For to you and to your fathers the Lord gave a law more excellent than to all peoples. 
\Verse And because your brethren transgressed the commandments of the Most High,

He brought vengeance upon you and upon them,

And He spared not the former,

And the latter also He gave into captivity:

And He left not a residue of them,


\Verse        But behold! you are here with me.


\Verse        If, therefore, you direct your ways aright,

Ye also shall not depart as your brethren departed,

But they shall come to you.


\Verse        For He is merciful whom you worship,

And He is gracious in whom you hope,

And He is true, so that He shall do good and not evil.


\Verse        Have you not seen here what has befallen Zion


\Verse        Or do you perchance think that the place had sinned,

And that on this account it was overthrown

Or that the land had wrought foolishness,

And that therefore it was delivered up


\Verse      And know you not that on account of you who did sin,

That which sinned not was overthrown,

And, on account of those who wrought wickedly,

That which wrought not foolishness was delivered up to (its) enemies'


\Verse And the whole people answered and said unto me: 'So far as we can recall the good things which the Mighty One has done unto us, we do recall them; and those things which we do not remember He in His mercy knows. 
\Verse Nevertheless, do this for us your people: write also to our brethren in Babylon an epistle of doctrine and a scroll of hope, that you may confirm them also before you do depart from us.


\Verse      For the shepherds of Israel have perished,

And the lamps which gave light are extinguished,

And the fountains have withheld their stream whence we used to drink.


\Verse      And we are left in the darkness,

And amid the trees of the forest,

And the thirst of the wilderness.'


\Verse      And I answered and said unto them

'Shepherds and lamps and fountains come from the law:

And though we depart, yet the law abides.


\Verse      If therefore you have respect to the law,

And are intent upon wisdom,

A lamp will not be wanting,

And a shepherd will not fail,

And a fountain will not dry up.


\Verse Nevertheless, as you said unto me, I will write also unto your brethren in Babylon, and I will send by means of men, and I will write in like manner to the nine tribes and a half, and send by means of a bird.' 
\Verse And it came to pass on the one and twentieth day in the eighth month that I, Baruch, came and sat down under the oak under the shadow of the branches, and no man was with me, but I was alone. 
\Verse And I wrote these two epistles: one I sent by an eagle to the nine and a half tribes; and the other I sent to those that were at Babylon by means of three men. 
\Verse And I called the eagle and spoke these words unto it: 
\Verse 'The Most High hath made you that you should be higher than all birds. 
\Verse And now go and tarry not in (any) place, nor enter a nest, nor settle upon any tree, till you have passed over the breadth of the many waters of the river Euphrates, and have gone to the people that dwell there, and cast down to them this epistle. 
\Verse Remember, moreover, that, at the time of the deluge, Noah received from a dove the fruit of the olive, when he sent it forth from the ark. 
\Verse Yea, also the ravens ministered to Elijah, bearing him food, as they had been commanded. 
\Verse Solomon also, in the time of his kingdom, whithersoever he wished to send or seek for anything, commanded a bird (to go thither), and it obeyed him as he commanded it. 
\Verse And now let it not weary you, and turn not to the right hand nor the left, but fly and go by a direct way, that you may preserve the command of the Mighty One, according as I said unto you.'

78—86. THE EPISTLE OF BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH WHICH HE

WROTE TO THE NINE AND A HALF TRIBES

\Chapter 
\Verse These are the words of that epistle which Baruch the son of Neriah sent to the nine and a half tribes, which were across the river Euphrates, in which these things were written.


\Verse Thus says Baruch the son of Neriah to the brethren carried into captivity: 'Mercy and peace.' I bear in mind, my brethren, the love of Him who created us, who loved us from of old, and never hated us, but above all educated us. 
\Verse And truly I know that behold all we the twelve tribes are bound by one bond, inasmuch as we are born from one father. 
\Verse Wherefore I have been the more careful to leave you the words of this epistle before I die, that you may be comforted regarding the evils which have come upon you, and that you may be grieved also regarding the evil that has befallen your brethren; and again, also, that you may justify His judgment which 
\Verse He has decreed against you that you should be carried away captive—for what you have suffered is disproportioned to what you have done—in order that, at the last times, you may be found worthy of your fathers. 
\Verse Therefore, if you consider that ye have now suffered those things for your good, that you may not finally be condemned and tormented, then you will receive eternal hope; if above all you destroy from your heart vain error, on account of which you departed hence. 
\Verse For if you so do these things, He will continually remember you, He who always promised on our behalf to those who were more excellent than we, that He will never forget or forsake us, but with much mercy will gather together again those who were dispersed.

\Chapter 
\Verse Now, my brethren, learn first what befell Zion: how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against us. 
\Verse For we have sinned against Him who made us, and we have not kept the commandments which he commanded us, yet he hath not chastened us as we deserved. 
\Verse For what befell you we also suffer in a preeminent degree, for it befell us also.

\Chapter 
\Verse And now, my brethren, I make known unto you that when the enemy had surrounded the city, the angels of the Most High were sent, and they overthrew the fortifications of the strong wall, and they destroyed the firm iron corners, which could not be rooted out. 
\Verse Nevertheless, they hid all the vessels of the sanctuary, lest the enemy should get possession of them. 
\Verse And when they had done these things, they delivered thereupon to the enemy the overthrown wall, and the plundered house, and the burnt temple, and the people who were overcome because they were delivered up, lest the enemy should boast and say: 
\Verse'Thus by force have we been able to lay waste even the house of the Most High in war.' Your brethren also have they bound and led away to Babylon, and have caused them to dwell there. 
\Verse But we have been left here, being very few. 
\Verse This is the tribulation about which I wrote to you. 
\Verse For assuredly I know that (the consolation of) the inhabitants of Zion consoles you : so far as you knew that it was prospered (your consolation) was greater than the tribulation which you endured in having to depart from it.

\Chapter 
\Verse But regarding consolation, hear the word. 
\Verse For I was mourning regarding Zion, and I prayed for mercy from the Most High, and I said:


\Verse        'How long will these things endure for us

And will these evils come upon us always'


\Verse        And the Mighty One did according to the multitude of His mercies,

And the Most High according to the greatness of His compassion,

And He revealed unto me the word, that I might receive consolation,

And He showed me visions that I should not again endure anguish,

And He made known to me the mystery of the times.

And the advent of the hours he showed me.

\Chapter 
\Verse Therefore, my brethren, I have written to you, that you may comfort yourselves regarding the multitude of your tribulations. 
\Verse For know you that our Maker will assuredly avenge us on all our enemies, according to all that they have done to us, also that the consummation which the Most High will make is very nigh, and His mercy that is coming, and the consummation of His judgment, is by no means far off.


\Verse        For lo! we see now the multitude of the prosperity of the Gentiles,

Though they act impiously,

But they shall be like a vapor:


\Verse        And we behold the multitude of their power,

Though they do wickedly,

But they shall be made like unto a drop:


\Verse        And we see the firmness of their might.

Though they resist the Mighty One every hour,

But they shall be accounted as spittle.


\Verse        And we consider the glory of their greatness,

Though they do not keep the statutes of the Most High,

But as smoke shall they pass away.


\Verse        And we meditate on the beauty of their gracefulness,

Though they have to do with pollutions,

But as grass that withers shall they fade away.


\Verse        And we consider the strength of their cruelty,

Though they remember not the end (thereof),

But as a wave that passes shall they be broken.


\Verse        And we remark the boastfulness of their might,

Though they deny the beneficence of God, who gave (it) to them,

But they shall pass away as a passing cloud.

\Chapter 
\Verse   [For the Most High will assuredly hasten His times,

And He will assuredly bring on His hours.


\Verse        And He will assuredly judge those who are in His world,

And will visit in truth all things by means of all their hidden works.


\Verse        And He will assuredly examine the secret thoughts,

And that which is laid up in the secret chambers of all the members of mail. And will make (them) manifest in the presence of all with reproof.


\Verse Let none therefore of these present things ascend into your hearts, but above all let us be expectant, because that which is promised to us shall come. 
\Verse And let us not now look unto the delights of the Gentiles in the present, but let us remember what has been promised to us in the end. 
\Verse For the ends of the times and of the seasons and whatsoever is with them shall assuredly pass by together. 
\Verse The consummation, moreover, of the age shall then show the great might of its ruler, when all things come to judgment. 
\Verse Do you therefore prepare your hearts for that which before you believed, lest you come to be in bondage in both worlds, so that you be led away captive here and be tormented there. 
\Verse For that which exists now or which has passed away, or which is to come, in all these things, neither is the evil fully evil, nor again the good fully good.


\Verse      For all healthinesses of this time are turning into diseases,


\Verse      And all might of this time is turning into weakness,

And all the force of this time is turning into impotence,


\Verse      And every energy of youth is turning into old age and consummation.

And every beauty of gracefulness of this time is turning faded and hateful,


\Verse      And every proud dominion of the present is turning into humiliation and shame,


\Verse      And every praise of the glory of this time is turning into the shame of silence,

And every vain splendor and insolence of this time is turning into voiceless ruin.


\Verse      And every delight and joy of this time is turning to worms and corruption,


\Verse      And every clamor of the pride of this time is turning into dust and stillness.


\Verse      And every possession of riches of this time is being turned into Sheol alone,


\Verse      And all the rapine of passion of this time is turning into involuntary death,

And every passion of the lusts of this time is turning into a judgment of torment.


\Verse      And every artifice and craftiness of this time is turning into a proof of the truth,


\Verse      And every sweetness of unguents of this time is turning into judgment and condemnation,


\Verse      And every love of lying is turning to contumely through truth.


\Verse [Since therefore all these things are done now, does anyone think that they will not be avenged But the consummation of all things will come to the truth.]

\Chapter 
\Verse Behold! I have therefore made known unto you (these things) whilst I live: for I have said (it) that you should learn the things that are excellent; for the Mighty One hath commanded me to instruct you: and I will set before you some of the commandments of His judgment before I die. 
\Verse Remember that formerly Moses assuredly called heaven and earth to witness against you and said: 'If you transgress the law you shall be dispersed, but if you keep it you shall be kept.' 
\Verse And other things also he used to say unto you when you the twelve tribes were together in the desert. 
\Verse And after his death you cast them away from you: on this account there came upon you what had been predicted. 
\Verse And now Moses used to tell you before they befell you, and lo! they have befallen you: for you have forsaken the law. 
\Verse Lo! I also say unto you after you have suffered, that if you obey those things which have been said unto you, you will receive from the Mighty One whatever has been laid up and reserved for you. 
\Verse Moreover, let this epistle be for a testimony between me and you, that you may remember the commandments of the Mighty One, and that also there may be to me a defense in the presence of Him who sent me. 
\Verse And remember you the law and Zion, and the holy land and your brethren, and the covenant of your fathers, and forget not the festivals and the Sabbaths. 
\Verse And deliver this epistle and the traditions of the law to your sons after you, as also your fathers delivered (them) to you. 
\Verse And at all times make request perseveringly and pray diligently with your whole heart that the Mighty One may be reconciled to you, and that He may not reckon the multitude of your sins, but remember the rectitude of your fathers. 
\Verse For if He judge us not according to the multitude of His mercies, woe unto all us who are born.

\Chapter 
\Verse   [Know, moreover, that

In former times and in the generations of old our fathers had helpers, 

Righteous men and holy prophets:


\Verse        No more, we were in our own land

[And they helped us when we sinned].
